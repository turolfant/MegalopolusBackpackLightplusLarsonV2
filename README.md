MegalopolusBackpackLightplusLarsonV2
====================================

LED VU Meter for my Boblebee backpack with Neopixels.
arIt combines a 16 Neopixel-Ring and 2 strands of 12 Neopixel(on the sides of the backpack).
It is powered by a akkupack of 6 Eneloop-Batteries with a UBEC(5Volt 3A).
The controller is a Floraboard(Adafruit).
I use a microphoneamplifier as input for the microconroller. 
It has differnt states:
1. Larsonscanner red on the ring
2. Larsonscanner red on both sides of the backpack
3. Random "blinky" on ring and both strands
4. Rainbowcollored pattern 
5. VU-Meter on both sides
